How to use GPU acceleration?
============================
(1) Load the Mali GPU device driver.
(2) Copy the GPU libraries to the target board and make sure the GPU libraries
	can be found by executable files.

-----Note-----
When you copy the GPU libraries, you had better use -d option for cp command
to copy the soft links because this can make the image size much less.
